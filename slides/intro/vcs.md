## VCS

* A way to keep track of changes to files and folders
* Between multiple authors
* A record of who did what and when
* Why is provided by commit messages
* Non distributed (Subversion and CVS): server has the master repository, all commits goes to the server
* Distributed (Git, Mercurial) : server has the master repository but every developer has a copy of the repository on his machine
