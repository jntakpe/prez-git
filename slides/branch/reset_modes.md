## Reset modes

* **soft** : does not reset working copy nor index. Useful if you are working on the wrong branch.
* **mixed** (default mode) : reset index but does not change working copy. Useful if after all you don't want to commit changes.
* **hard** : reset index and working copy. Useful if you want to dump all the changes
